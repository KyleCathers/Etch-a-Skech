Etch a sketch project from Odin Project foundations

Initial commit with basic buttons including adjustable resolution (8 - 100pixels), black button, rainbow button, erase button, clear button, and RGB select button.

Optional to do: Add color "opacity" gradient effect, holding the cursor on one spot will darken the pixel (starting from white) over 10 "events"
